## Features

-   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) App Router
    -   Advanced routing for seamless navigation and performance
    -   React Server Components (RSCs) and Server Actions for server-side rendering and increased performance
-   [chakra-ui](https://www.chakra-ui.com)
-   Dark Mode
    -   Toggle between light and dark themes for improved user experience

## Running Locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install

npm run dev
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Usage

Once the app is running, you can navigate to different sections using the app router. Use the dark mode toggle to switch between themes for a better user experience.
